1.  In R, run **attach(faithful)**, how would you get the column names for the faithful dataset?

2.  How would you create a histogram of the eruptions dataaset?  This dataset comes with the previous attachment.  

3.  How would you now create a histogram for the same dataset only with three bars?

4.  We are going to use the PlantGrowth dataset.  Run the following:

```{r}
plant.df = PlantGrowth
plant.df$group = factor(plant.df$group,
  labels = c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))
```

Describe what these two commands have done.  

5.  Create a linear model using the **lm** method between the two column names of the plant.df data frame.  

6.  Is the linear model a good fit for this data?  Show why you think so.
