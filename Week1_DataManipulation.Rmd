This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

R is a scripting language so we can just run this and it doesn't need to get compiled into any other form.

First we will set the working directory:
```{r}
setwd("/Users/alexander.frieden/Documents/biostats/Rcode/")
```

Then we are going to load data in.  A lot of data is loaded from file formats

```{r}
mydata = read.table("dummyTable.txt")
mydata
```

We can also check the class for an object, in this case it will be a data frame

```{r}
class(mydata)
```

As we can see, our table has headers:
```{r}
mydata <- read.table("dummyTable.txt",header = TRUE)
mydata
```

Notice now all of our data has nice headers.  And we can index off of them. This will give us a data frame. 

```{r}
mydata["val1"]
```

This will give us an array.  

```{r}
mydata$val1
```

We can do basic vector math

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(10,11,12,13)
a+b
```

Other vector operations

```{r}
min(a,b)
max(a,b)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
